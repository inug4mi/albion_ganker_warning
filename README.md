# Albion ganker warning

## What is it?

This code makes a warning telling the number of PK's in a map on the game Albion Online.


## Why is useful?

Sometime you are in red zone farming and you want to chill on your phone a little bit, or maybe you'd want to go to the bathroom real quick. Then this scripts will make a warning telling the number of PK'S on the zone. (you can modify the "warning"). In this case there is a voice that "speaks up" the number of pk's.

## How to use?

This code works for screens with a resolution of 1920x1080 (the same resolution as Albion).

If you want to use another resolution, you need to change the coordinate points where screenshots are taken based on the number of PKs on the map. You can obtain these points using the MouseCoordinates.py script.


## Observations

Some numbers are not well detected or mistaken. It mistakes number 9 with 5 and has no idea about the number 7, the number 1 wasn't well detected.

The solutions on this is making a better image processing algorithm that improves the accuracy for detecting numbers based on images.

The "worst" solution would be to hardcode the array of the representing number as I did with the number 1. As the number 1 wasn't detected, I took the picture of the number one after the image proccessing, then extracted it's numpy array version so, this may work for comparing the undetected number 1 image with the already known number 1 image (hardcoded number 1 array).
